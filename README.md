# hostel-room-allocation
Developed a Django-based Hostel Room Allocation System that automates hostel allotment using student preferences and availability. The system supports block-wise and room-type-wise allocation with priority rules (Single, Double, Triple sharing), secure authentication, admin management, and a clean, responsive dashboard deployed on Render.
